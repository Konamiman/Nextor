	SUBTTL	Sample Messages File (Kanji)
;
;
;        This is a sample messages file for MSX2-DOS.SYS. It contains messages
; and text in Kanji in the format required by the MSX2-DOS .REL files.
;
;        Care  should be taken when changing this file that spaces within each
; message are preserved.  Any of the messages may be changed to a null string,
; and indeed in the standard Kanji  messages  given  here  some  messages  are
; already null.
;
;
;        These  messages  are  used  by  MSX-DOS.SYS  by looking for the 'n'th
; string, where n is the number corresponding to the string required.  In  all
; cases, the actual value of 'n' is defined by a label defined as external  in
; this module, so the messages can be in any order. The strings themselves are
; ordinary ASCII strings terminated by a null (0).
;
;        A macro MSG is used here to  define  the  strings  and  the  external
; lables.  It is used in the form: 1) MSG NAME,<STRING> or 2) MSG NAME. In the
; former case, an external lable of the for __NAME with an  appropriate  value
; is  declared, and the string is defined with DEFBs with the null on the end.
; In the latter case, the label is still defined but no text is defined.  This
; allows  following  DEFBs  to  define the text, which may be on more than one
; line. Don't forget a DEFB 0 at the end though !.

;
;        The first three messages are not actually printed at all, but contain
; the  valid  responses  to  the 'Abort, Retry, Ignore' disk error prompts. No
; upper casing is performed by the disk error routine, so both the  upper  and
; the lower case versions of the characters must be included in these strings.
;
;
	MSG	ABORT			; Abort characters.
	 DEFB	'Aa',CTRL_C,0
;
	MSG	RETRY			; Retry characters.
	 DEFB	'Rr',0
;
	MSG	IGNORE			; Ignore characters.
	 DEFB	'Ii',0
;
;
;
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;        Disk  error  prompts  ('Abort,  Retry'  messages)  are printed in two
; lines. The first line is printed in the following form:
;
;         Not ready reading drive A:
;       \/\       /\      /\     / \/
;       a   --b--    --c-    -e-   f
;
;         Not ready writing drive A:
;       \/\       /\      /\     / \/
;       a   --b--    --d-    -e-   f
;
;
;        Part (b) is an error message returned by the BDOS, and is not part of
; this messages file.  Part (a) is null in the Kanji versions, but is included
; for greater flexibility in providing messages for other languages.  Part (f)
; is  printed  immediately after the drive letter, and is just a colon (:)  in
; English.  For other languages it could be replaced  by  a  longer  piece  of
; text.   At  the  end  of  the message, a CR, LF is printed by the disk error
; routine.
;
;
	MSG	PRERR			; Part (a) printed before disk error.
	 DEFB	0			;   (null in Japanese)

;
	MSG	READING			; Part (c), one leading space.
	 DEFB	" (�ǂ�",0
;
	MSG	WRITING			; Part (d), one leading psace.
	 DEFB	" (����",0
;
	MSG	DRIVE			; Part (e).
	 DEFB	"���ݒ�) �h���C�u��",0
;
	MSG	ARIDRV			; Printed after the drive letter.
	 DEFB	':',0
;
;
;
;        The  second  line  of  the disk error message has two forms, the form
; actually printed depending on whether 'ignore' is considered  dangerous.  In
; the English messages, if 'ignore'  is  not  recommended  then  the  'ignore'
; option is not printed, although it will still be accepted as a response. The
; messages are straight forward, and are not split into different sections.
;
;
	MSG	AR		; Message for when 'ignore' is not recommended.
	 DEFB	"���~(A)/�Ď��s(R)? ",0
;
	MSG	ARI		; Message for when 'ignore' isn't so dangerous.
	 DEFB	"���~(A)/�Ď��s(R)/����(I)? ",0

;
;        When  COMMAND.COM  is  loaded by MSX-DOS.SYS (ie.  before it has been
; loaded for the first time) a prompt will be printed if COMMAND.COM cannot be
; found  on  disk or if an error occurs. If an error does occur, then an error
; message will be printed before the prompt.
;
; The error message takes the form:
;
;       *** Disk operation aborted
;       \  /\                    /\/
;        a    --------b---------  c
;
;
; The actual prompt is printed in two lines and takes the form:
;
;       Insert COMMAND.COM disk in drive A:
;       \                               /\/
;         --------------d--------------  e
;
;       Press any key to continue...
;       \                           /
;         ------------f------------
;
;
;        Part  (c) is null in English, but is included for greater flexibility
; in converting  the  messages  to  other  languages.   Part  (e)  is  printed
; immediately after the drive letter, and in English is just a colon (:),  but
; could  be a longer text message. Part (b) is not defined in this module, but
; is the message returned by the BDOS in the MSX-DOS.SYS. Part (f) is  similar
; to the message printed by the 'PAUSE' command in COMMAND.COM. After both the
; messages above, a CR, LF is printed by MSX-DOS.SYS.
;
;        Note that COMMAND.COM itself  prints  similar  messages  when  it  is
; trying  to  re-load  itself  from  disk  after  running a program, and it is
; desirable that the messages here and in COMMAND.COM are similar.
;
;        A special variation of the error message printing occurs  when  there
; is not enough memory for  MSX-DOS.SYS  to  start  up  (it  needs  to  reside
; entirely in page 3). In this case, the message NOMEM is printed as the error
; message, and the system then just halts. Is useful if this  message  informs
; the user of this (as the standard English message given here  does),  rather
; than  the  machine  just  dying. Similarly, the message BADVER is printed if
; MSXDOS.SYS is run under a pre-2.00 version of the system.
